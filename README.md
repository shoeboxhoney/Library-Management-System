# Library-Management-System
This Library Management System has three main classes for ‘Book’, ‘Member’, and ‘Library’. The ‘Library’ class manages a collection of books and members, allowing users to add new books, register as members, and search for books by title. The program supports issuing books based on either a book object or a genre. It features case-insensitive title searches and ensures that each member has a unique ID. The ‘LMSOperations’ namespace contains helper functions for adding books and members to the library. Additionally, the program allows users to interactively search for a book by title and issue it if found, while handling the case when a book is not available. The code also includes checks to ensure users do not issue non-existent books, making the system user-friendly.
